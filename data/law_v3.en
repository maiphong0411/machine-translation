Nhưng chúng ta chỉ có thể hành động vì công lý, Một khi đã nhìn ra công lý Và tuyệt đối
a) Officials and public employees are regulated in the law on officials and public employees
Abuse thrives only in silence .
Before I die , I want to be tried for piracy.
Because in the mean time , the German Constitutional Court ruled that the implementation of this E.U. directive into German law was unconstitutional .
They were lawyers , journalists , priests , they all said : " We don 't want this . 
One day , my worst nightmare came true , when I was caught by the Chinese police and brought to the police station for interrogation .
When I was a teenager , I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course , we got pulled over , and all it took was a " Sorry , officer , " and we were on our way .
One day , my worst nightmare came true , when I was caught by the Chinese police and brought to the police station for interrogation .
Since my family couldn 't understand Chinese , I thought my family was going to be arrested .
So I decided to start a lawsuit against them , because I wanted to have this information .
The city came down on me , and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden , which this citation was turning into a warrant .
I 'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information I ask for .
But even after we got past the border , my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing .
But I will do a trial .
Because in the mean time , the German Constitutional Court ruled that the implementation of this E.U. directive into German law was unconstitutional .
Because in the summer of 2006 , the E.U. Commission tabled a directive .
I can 't reveal many details [ about ] how I left North Korea , but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine I was sent to China to live with distant relatives .
Almost two years have passed since the Libyan Revolution broke out , inspired by the waves of mass mobilization in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions .
So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed , and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in North Korea .
North Koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom .
Aware of the devastation and the challenges , I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society , calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation .
They have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi .
The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people when we needed it most , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need .
I did everything to get my family to freedom , and we came so close , but my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the South Korean embassy .
But then I said , I want to go out with this information .
This morning , the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor , and said , " Can we -- can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial ? 
When I was little , I thought my country was the best on the planet , and I grew up singing a song called " Nothing To Envy . "
Every year , countless North Koreans are caught in China and repatriated to North Korea , where they can be tortured , imprisoned or publicly executed .
However , Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden , a legacy of tyranny , corruption and seeds of diversions .
I met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections , an environment which was increasingly polarized , an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion .
If you have access to this information , you can control your society .
We have no freedom , " they said .
And some even said , this would be Stasi 2.0 .
This morning , the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor , and said , " Can we -- can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial ? "
When these villagers claimed their freedom , the slaveholders burned down all of their houses .
Government ? Forget about it !
Almost 200 organizations were established in Benghazi during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi -- almost 300 in Tripoli .
North Koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom .
 I 'm helping the North Korean people . 
These are the ideals that a war-torn Libya needs desperately in order to achieve peace .
However , bit by bit , the euphoria of the elections , and of the revolution as a whole , was fading out -- for every day we were waking up to the news of violence .
Even though they were caught , they were eventually released after heavy international pressure .
I have never , ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in her exile : " Son , resist Gaddafi . Fight him .
I met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections , an environment which was increasingly polarized , an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion .
I find that Americans see the fragility in changes .
Every year , countless North Koreans are caught in China and repatriated to North Korea , where they can be tortured , imprisoned or publicly executed .
Someone had accused me of being North Korean , so they tested my Chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions .
Although I often wondered about the outside world , I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea , until everything suddenly changed .
I have never , ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in her exile : " Son , resist Gaddafi . Fight him .
On another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate .
 The Taliban are gone !  my father shouted .
We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage .
And we need to establish that existentially before we do so sociopolitically .
We can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world , because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside , and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside .
Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical , quantitative representation of the feminine .
Suddenly , there was no country I could proudly call my own .
Ultimately , more than a million North Koreans died during the famine , and many only survived by eating grass , bugs and tree bark .
During Taliban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
My councilman even called in and said how they endorse and love what we 're doing .
On top of that , Manuru has tuberculosis , yet he 's still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft .
And of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .
I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so petrified , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere , and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own , so that now they do the same back-breaking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
Over 85 percent of abusers are men , and domestic abuse happens only in intimate , interdependent , long-term relationships , in other words , in families , the last place we would want or expect to find violence , which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing .
Other outcomes include long-term stalking , even after the abuser remarries , denial of financial resources and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children , who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother .
The first time , I was driving to find a secret beach and I got lost , and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver 's side window .
If you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup , how short my skirts were , where I lived , what jobs I took , who my friends were and where I spent Christmas , I would have laughed at you , because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in Conor at the beginning .
I was 22 , and in the United States , women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages , and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners , boyfriends , and husbands in the United States .
Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage .
Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her ?
Because it turns out that I 'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor .
Now , Conor did not come home one day and announce , " You know , hey , all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next phase where I isolate you and I abuse you " — — " so I need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises . 
I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who beats me , but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age .
It was an isolated incident , and he was never going to hurt me again .
I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment , and I got frustrated , and Conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream , and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall .
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts .
Patronizing , I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants .
You have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it .
Potholes , of course , that can become a problem , but we have a solution .
He not only brags about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul .
Driving down a road in Ghana with partners of Free the Slaves , a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window .
A conservative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people enslaved in the world today .
In Kathmandu , I was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves .
