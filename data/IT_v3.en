The sky appears to drift overhead from east to west, completing a full circuit around the sky in 24 (Sidereal) hours. This phenomenon is due to the spinning of the Earth on its axis.

As the Earth spins; they remain fixed in the sky, and all other points seem to rotate around them. The celestial poles are also the poles of the Equatorial Coordinate System, meaning they have Declinations of +90 degrees and -90 degrees (for the North and South celestial poles, respectively).

The second type of memory, is called virtual or swap memory. This block of memory, is actually space on the hard drive. The operating system reserves a space on the hard drive for swap space. The operating system can use this virtual memory (or swap space), if it runs out of physical memory. The reason this is called swap memory, is the operating system takes some data that it does n't think you will want for a while, and saves that to disk in this reserved space. The operating system then loads the new data you need right now. It has swapped the not needed data, for the data you need right now. Virtual or swap memory is not as fast as physical memory, so operating systems try to keep data (especially often used data), in the physical memory.

However, the problem was n't completely solved by the Julian calendar, because a tropical year is n't 365.25 days long; it's 365.24219 days long. You still have a calendar drift problem, it just takes many centuries to become noticeable. And so, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII instituted the Gregorian calendar, which was largely the same as the Julian Calendar, with one more trick added for leap years: even Century years (those ending with the digits 00) are only leap years if they are divisible by 400. So, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years (though they would have been under the Julian Calendar), whereas the year 2000 was a leap year. This change makes the average length of a year 365.2425 days. So, there is still a tiny calendar drift, but it amounts to an error of only 3 days in 10,000 years. The Gregorian calendar is still used as a standard calendar throughout most of the world.

For sequential code, collecting statistical data of the programs runtime characteristic like time numbers spent in functions and code lines usually is enough. This is called Profiling. The program is run under control of a profiling tool, which gives the summary of an execution run at the end.

The rasterization is done by a Raster Image Processor (RIP, often the Ghostscript software) or some other filtering instance.

An example. I teach Railway staff how to respond to accidents. I wanted to use a slide to discuss how you can move dangerous loads from a derailed or damaged rail vehicle to a road vehicle after an accident. The slide I made had a simple drawing of tank wagon, the kind used for carrying gases or oils. On the side I wrote Lethal Chemical Company so that I do not have to explain it. I wanted to make several important points. First, you must get any overhead electric wires turned off before you do anything if they are within a certain distance. I drew one of the supporting structures and drew an arrow with the safety distance on it. Then I wanted to say that you must not transfer the wagon's contents in darkness or thunderstorms. I drew a moon and a lightning bolt above the vehicle. You must get specialist advice, so I drew a sheet of paper and wrote the word Plan near the vehicle. You also have to ensure that the vehicle does not move when the weight inside is removed. I drew little red wedges by the wheels. Everything I need to talk about is on this drawing. All I have to do is look at the drawing and it tells me what I need to cover. When I have covered all the things in the drawing, I have finished on that subject.

So, that's all we need from & DCOP;; now it's just a case of writing a script around it. Here's a (very!) rough implementation:
Trap signals and other events. Defines and activates handlers to be run when the shell receives signals or other conditions. ARG is a command to be read and executed when the shell receives the signal(s) SIGNAL_SPEC. If ARG is absent (and a single SIGNAL_SPEC is supplied) or `-', each specified signal is reset to its original value. If ARG is the null string each SIGNAL_SPEC is ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes. If a SIGNAL_SPEC is EXIT (0) ARG is executed on exit from the shell. If a SIGNAL_SPEC is DEBUG, ARG is executed before every simple command. If a SIGNAL_SPEC is RETURN, ARG is executed each time a shell function or a script run by the . or source builtins finishes executing. A SIGNAL_SPEC of ERR means to execute ARG each time a command's failure would cause the shell to exit when the -e option is enabled. If no arguments are supplied, trap prints the list of commands associated with each signal. Options: -l\tprint a list of signal names and their corresponding numbers -p\tdisplay the trap commands associated with each SIGNAL_SPEC Each SIGNAL_SPEC is either a signal name in <signal\.h> or a signal number. Signal names are case insensitive and the SIG prefix is optional. A signal may be sent to the shell with "kill -signal $$". Exit Status: Returns success unless a SIGSPEC is invalid or an invalid option is given.

On the right side a "overview"-column is visible left of the vertical scrollbar. It shows the compressed summary column of input" A ". All the differences and conflicts are visible at one glance. When only two input windows are used, then all differences appear red here because every difference is also a conflict. A black rectangle frames the visible part of the inputs. For very long input files, when the number of input lines is bigger than the height of the overview column in pixels, then several input lines share one overview line. A conflict then has top priority over simple differences, which have priority over no change, so that no difference or conflict is lost here. By clicking into this overview column the corresponding text will be shown.

The column to the left of the 1 requires a quick run down and back up, with careful dodging both ways to avoid the enemies. To get the gold in the middle of the 6, drop down on the top of the'O 'part of the 6, move right/ dig left and immediately move left and dig left to delay the enemy who otherwise is likely to catch you. However, you may wish to leave this piece of gold to the end so as not to free two additional enemies earlier; it is possible to get two enemies to retrap themselves in that section, though. To get the gold held by enemies in the bottom right, dig out the blocking square to their left, run up the ladder, dig off the right side of the 6, drop in, run left and dig off a square on the left side of the 6 and drop to the floor. The timing is tight - only one or two enemies in the bottom right section will be able to move to the next section to the left. You will still need to dig out the bottom of the 6 to get their gold, but that is straightforward albeit a bit hectic because of the enemies lingering to the left of the 6. Once you have gotten all the gold, you may find it easiest to exit by passing through the middle false floor on the 1 and exiting via the ladders on the left of the 1.

Regular expressions are easy to use but often there is another much faster way to achieve the same result. Consider you only want to match the character '# 'if it is the first character in the line. A regular expression based solution would look like this: lt; RegExpr attribute=quot; Macroquot; context=quot; macroquot; String=quot; ^\\s*#quot; / gt; You can achieve the same much faster in using: lt; DetectChar attribute=quot; Macroquot; context=quot; macroquot; char=quot; #quot; firstNonSpace=quot; truequot; / gt; If you want to match the regular expression '^#' you can still use DetectChar with the attribute column=quot; 0quot;. The attribute column counts character based, so a tabulator still is only one character.

A nuclear isomer is a metastable or isomeric state of an atom caused by the excitation of a proton or neutron in its nucleus so that it requires a change in spin before it can release its extra energy. They decay to lower energy states of the nuclide through two isomeric transitions: [br] - > & #947; - emission (emission of a high-energy photon)[br] - > internal conversion (the energy is used to ionize the atom)[br] Contrast this with the definition of a chemical isomer, the more common use of the word. Also contrast with the meaning of isotope, in which the difference is the number of neutrons in the nucleus. Metastable isomers of a particular atom are usually designated with an "m" (or, in the case of atoms with more than one isomer, 2m, 3m, and so on). This designation is usually placed after the atomic symbol and number of the atom (e. g., Co-58m), but is sometimes placed as a superscript before (e. g., [sup]m[/ sup]Co-58 or [sup]58m[/ sup]Co).

Therefore the page accounting of & CUPS; is only an approximation (in many cases an excellent or at least good one, in others a quite poor one). The only reliable print count is the one done by the internal printer counter. (Because this is the one you pay for, if you are on a click price or similar.) Some, by far not most, printers can be queried remotely for that information via SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). That means, in a bigger network with many different printers there is just no completely reliable and accurate page accounting tool!

The internal name for the Save Document action is action/ file_save. The lock down framework also provides a set of more abstract restrictions which can be used to disable functionality not covered by a single action. An example is the shell_access restriction which disables all functionality that would offer the user access to a & UNIX; shell.

The first one uses the name of the PHP executable. & kommander; searches PATH for php and if it is not found looks to see if it is registered with & kommander; in a location outside of your path. If not it tells the user it cannot be found. The second examples uses the classic shebang which can have some benefits and also problems.

The Pyramid of Djoser (Zoser), or step pyramid (kbhw-ntrw in Egyptian) is an archeological remain in the Saqqara necropolis, Egypt, northwest of the city of Memphis. To complete this level, it is important to proceed in steps: first free the mummy on the left side of the second level (from the bottom), allowing it to drop into and fill the hidden pit on the ground level. Now enter the right side of the second level and move across the pole, over the mummy, and get the piece of treasure in the middle, being sure to dig out the brick to the left of the middle. The mummy on the third level is a bit problematic because it will take a piece of treasure and carry it. You may get lucky and find that it abandons its treasure at some point, but you can also trap him in the one diggable brick on the right with careful timing. Finally, before getting the last piece of treasure, be sure to open the bottom right of the step pyramid to allow the mummies on the right to enter the pyramid - if there is more than one mummy on the bottom right before the escape ladder appears, you will be unable to reach the exit.

JPEG: The Joint Photographic Experts Group's file format is a good Web file format but it uses lossy data compression. PNG: the Portable Network Graphics format is an extensible file format for the lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images.

PNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications, such as the World Wide Web, so it is fully streamable with a progressive display option. Also, PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color matching on heterogeneous platforms.

Most current digital cameras produce images with several brightly colored & quot; bad pixelsquot; when using slow shutter speeds. Night images can be ruined by these & quot; bad pixelsquot;. There are three different types of & quot; bad pixelsquot;: Stuck pixels: it's a pixel that always reads high or is always on to maximum power on all exposures. This produces a bright pixel usually of red, blue or green color in the final image. A stuck pixel will occur regardless of shutter speed, aperture size or any other user settings. It will occur on a normal exposure and tends to be more obvious under bright condition. Dead pixels: it's a pixel that reads zero or is always off on all exposures. This state produces a black pixel in the final image. Similar to stuck pixel, a dead pixel will occur regardless of shutter speed, aperture size or any other user settings. Hot pixels: it's a pixel that reads high (bright) on longer exposures as white, red, or green color. The longer the exposure time, the more visible hot pixels will become. These pixels will not be visible in bright conditions. Note that stuck or dead pixels will occur at the same location for all images. If the location of the stuck or dead pixel occurs at different locations, it may be a Hot Pixel.

The Refocus technique works differently from Unsharp Mask and is also unlike the Sharpen Filter which both increase the contrast of the edges of an image. Refocus rather reverses the process by which the image got blurred by the circular aperture of the camera. This method gives you as much of the original & quot; in focusquot; image as possible. Refocus uses a very powerful deconvolution algorithm that will reclaim the data that has been mixed up. In mathematical terms, blurring is usually the result of a convolution, a deconvolution will reverse the process, this is exactly what Refocus is doing. Furthermore, the FIR filter technique allows to remove much of the noise and granularity that often gets accentuated in the sharpening process of all sharpening filters.
Now some examples of commands that give output: $x = ask "Please type something and press OK... thanks!" $r = random 1,100 The ask command takes a string as input, and outputs the number or string that is entered. As you can see, the output of ask is stored in the container x. The random command also gives output. In this case it outputs a number between 1 and 100. The output of the random is again stored in a container, named r. Note that the containers x and r are not used in the example code above.

Most accepted theories on the construction of the pyramids are based on the idea that it was built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place. The disagreements center on the method by which the stones were conveyed and placed. Regardless, there were likely many ladders involved in its construction, such as on this level. This level is mostly a run around. Picking up the treasure while avoiding mummies is not so hard - but getting treasure away from the mummies is a much harder task. The three-wide stone platform is a useful killing field, although you'll have to run around a bit to get the mummies carrying treasure to line up properly. Note also that the middle block of this platform is a fall-through block. And once you've gotten all the treasure, you'll need to cross over to the escape ladder. One way to do this is to kill a mummy and cross over on its back when the mummy crosses from the escape ladder to the main pyramid.

p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Real Time Scheduling The Real Time scheduling class is given first access to the disk, regardless of what else is going on in the system. Thus the Real Time class needs to be used with some care, as it can starve other processes. As with the Best Effort class, 8 priority levels are defined denoting how big a time slice a given process will receive on each scheduling window.

Another measurement method is to simulate things happening in the computer system when executing a given code, & ie; execution driven simulation. The simulation is always derived from a more or less accurate machine model; however, with very detailed machine models, giving very close approximations to reality, the simulation time can be unacceptably high in practice. The advantage of simulation is that arbitrarily complex measurement/ simulation code can be inserted in a given code without perturbing results. Doing this directly before execution (called runtime instrumentation), using the original binary, is very comfortable for the user: no re-compilation is necessary. Simulation becomes usable when simulating only parts of a machine with a simple model; another advantage is that the results produced by simple models are often easier to understand: often, the problem with real hardware is that results include overlapping effects from different parts of the machine.

With larger movements of the physical device, you can move the mouse pointer rapidly to different areas on the screen.

In addition to displaying differences between a source and destination file, & kompare; can be used to create and view a special file called a & apos; diffapos;. This file captures the differences between the two sources into a single file that can be used to view and apply changes to any other copy of the file. For example, if two people are editing a document. The first person wants to make changes and send just the changes made to the second person. Normally, the first person would send a complete copy of the modified document to the second person, who would then have to compare the modified document side-by-side with unmodified version. The process for this is much like what we have described in the previous paragraphs. With & kompare; the first person would first make a local copy of the file to be modified, then make changes and compare the original and modified copy. Now using & kompare; a diff file can be created that captures only the changes made. This can be sent to the second person in place of a whole file containing the changes.

Physical deterioration of the media happens more rapidly with paper and CD-Rs than the average of film. Yet while film lasts longer (sometimes decades longer) than other forms of media, the right kind of backup of digital media never loses anything. Film decays - digital 1's and 0's do not, and film starts to decay the moment it's created and developed. It will never have the same color, contrast, & etc; that it did have a moment before. Digital does n't do that. However, digital is susceptible to corruption! And yes, physical media such as floppies and magnetic hard drives are also susceptible to the decay of the medium, just like CDs are. They just last longer.

Note Segment Items::. Support for interactive playback control ("PBC") was added. Support for playing related access by providing a scan point index file was added. ("/ EXT/ SCANDATA. DAT")Support for closed captions. Support for mixing NTSC and PAL content. By adding PAL support to the Video CD 1.1 specification, the following resolutions became available:352 x 240 @ 29.97 Hz (NTSC SIF).352 x 240 @ 23.976 Hz (FILM SIF).352 x 288 @ 25 Hz (PAL SIF).

This option forces a specific DPI value for fonts. It may be useful when the real DPI of the hardware is not detected properly and it is also often misused when poor quality fonts are used that do not look well with DPI values other than 96 or 120 DPI.

DisplaySize in xorg. conf or adding -dpi value to ServerLocalArgs= in $KDEDIR/ share/ config/ kdm/ kdmrc). When fonts do not render properly with real DPI value better fonts should be used or configuration of font hinting should be checked.

Abbreviation for P ostScript P rinter D escription; PPDs are ASCII files storing all information about the special capabilities of a printer, plus definitions of the (PostScript- or PJL-) commands to call on a certain capability (like print duplexing). As the explanation of the acronym reveals, PPDs were originally only used for & PostScript; printers. & CUPS; has extended the PPD concept to all types of printers. PPDs for & PostScript; printers are provided by the printer vendors. They can be used with & CUPS; and KDEPrint to have access to the full features of any & PostScript; printer. The KDEPrint Team recommends using a PPD originally intended for use with & Microsoft; Windows NT. PPDs for non-PostScript printers need a companion "filter" to process the & PostScript; print files into a format digestible for the non-PostScript target device. Those PPD/ filter combos are not (yet) available from the vendors. After the initiative by the & CUPS; developers to utilize PPDs, the Free Software community was creative enough to quickly come up with support for most of the currently used printer models, through PPDs and classical Ghostscript filters. But note: the printout quality varies from "hi-quality photographic output" (using Gimp-Print with most Epson inkjets) to "hardly readable" (using Foomatic-enabled Ghostscript filters for models rated as "paperweight" in the Linuxprinting. org database).

This option specifies how much KWin will try to prevent unwanted focus stealing caused by unexpected activation of new windows. (Note: This feature does not work with the Focus Under Mouse or Focus Strictly Under Mouse focus policies.) None: Prevention is turned off and new windows always become activated. Low: Prevention is enabled; when some window does not have support for the underlying mechanism and KWin cannot reliably decide whether to activate the window or not, it will be activated. This setting may have both worse and better results than the medium level, depending on the applications. Medium: Prevention is enabled. High: New windows get activated only if no window is currently active or if they belong to the currently active application. This setting is probably not really usable when not using mouse focus policy. Extreme: All windows must be explicitly activated by the user.

The Khufu ship is an intact full-size vessel from Ancient Egypt that was sealed into a pit in the Giza pyramid complex at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza around 2,500 BC. The ship was almost certainly built for Khufu (King Cheops). It is one of the oldest, largest, and best-preserved vessels from antiquity, and measures 43.6 m overall. Despite its age, it could sail today if put into water. This is almost a simple level: good treasure and not too many mummies. But your task is to wrest the treasure they carry.

For example, a wavelength of lambda = 10 meter lies in the radio region of the electromagnetic spectrum and has a frequency of f = c / lambda = 3 * 10^8 m/ s / 10 = 30 MHz where c is the speed of light. The energy of this photon is E = h * v = 6.625 * 10^-34 J s * 30 Mhz = 1.988 * 10^-26 joules. On the other hand, visible light has much shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies. A photon that has a wavelength of lambda = 5 * 10^-9 meters (A greenish photon) has an energy E = 3.975 * 10^-17 joules which is over a billion times higher than the energy of a radio photon. Similarly, a photon of red light (wavelength lambda = 700 nm) has less energy than a photon of violet light (wavelength lambda = 400 nm).

If you're not a programmer you may want that in laymans terms. In number one, if you launch & kommander; from a console then the console is the calling program.

The last entry type is the LISTEN directive. The formal syntax is nbsp; LISTEN nbsp; [interface nbsp; [multicastnbsp; list]] If one or more LISTEN lines are specified, & kdm; listens for & XDMCP; requests only on the specified interfaces. interface may be a hostname or IP address representing a network interface on this machine, or the wildcard * to represent all available network interfaces. If multicast group addresses are listed on a LISTEN line, & kdm; joins the multicast groups on the given interface. For IPv6 multicasts, the IANA has assigned ff0 X :0:0:0:0:0:0:12b as the permanently assigned range of multicast addresses for & XDMCP;. The X in the prefix may be replaced by any valid scope identifier, such as 1 for Node-Local, 2 for Link-Local, 5 for Site-Local, and so on (see IETF RFC 2373 or its replacement for further details and scope definitions). & kdm; defaults to listening on the Link-Local scope address ff02:0:0:0:0:0:0:12b to most closely match the IPv4 subnet broadcast behavior. If no LISTEN lines are given, & kdm; listens on all interfaces and joins the default & XDMCP; IPv6 multicast group (when compiled with IPv6 support). To disable listening for & XDMCP; requests altogether, a LISTEN line with no addresses may be specified, but using the [Xdmcp] Enable option is preferred.

& blinken; is based on an electronic game released in 1978, which challenges players to remember sequences of increasing length. On the face of the device, there are 4 different color buttons, each one with their own distinctive sound. These buttons light up randomly, creating the sequence that the player must then recall. If the player is successful in remembering the sequence of lights in the correct order, they advance to the next stage, where an identical sequence with one extra step is presented. If they are incorrect, the game is lost, and the player must start again from the beginning. The goal is to get a high score - each step in the sequence is worth one point, so correct entry of a sequence of 8 lights is worth 8 points on the high score table.

Of course, we know that the objects in the sky are not on the surface of a sphere centered on the Earth, so why bother with such a construct? Everything we see in the sky is so very far away, that their distances are impossible to gauge just by looking at them. Since their distances are indeterminate, you only need to know the direction toward the object to locate it in the sky. In this sense, the celestial sphere model is a very practical model for mapping the sky.

Generic term for different variants of the traditional & UNIX; printing method. Its first version appeared in the early 70s on BSD & UNIX; and was formally described in RFC 1179 only as late as 1990. At the time when BSD "remote" printing was first designed, printers were serially or otherwise directly connected devices to a host (with the Internet hardly consisting of more than 100 nodes!); printers used hole-punched, continuous paper, fed through by a tractor mechanism, with simple rows of ASCII text mechanically hammered on to the medium, drawn from a cardboard box beneath the table. It came out like a zig-zag folded paper "snake". Remote printing consisted of a neighboring host in the next room sending a file asking for printout. How technology has changed! Printers generally use cut-sheet media, they have built-in intelligence to compute the raster images of pages after pages that are sent to them using one of the powerful page description languages (PDL). Many are network nodes in their own right, with CPU, RAM, a hard disk and their own Operation System, and are hooked to a net with potentially millions of users... It is a vast proof of the flexible & UNIX; concept for doing things, that it made "Line Printing" reliably work even under these modern conditions. But time has finally come now to go for something new -- the IPP.

Meta contacts are one of the features of & kopete; that make sense once you figure out what they are. Until you do, they annoy you. They are basically a way of taking a contact on one network (such as MSN) and linking it to another contact on a different network.

This also lets you assign names to your meta-contacts that do n't change when people change their names on their account, this is useful if you have contacts who insist upon setting their MSN nick to something like =EF=81=8A.
